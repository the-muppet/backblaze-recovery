# I need my shit Back(Blaze)!

## Overview

This project provides a set of scripts to streamline the process of restoring data from Backblaze B2 cloud storage. With different run options allowing for full-bucket sync or targeted single file retrieval.

## Components

- `Update-Powershell.ps1`: Ensures PowerShell 7+ is installed and up to date.
- `Recovery-Setup1.ps1`: Sets up WSL2 and Docker Desktop.
- `Recovery-Setup2.ps1`: Completes the setup process and prepares for data restoration.
- `restore.py`: Handles the actual data restoration from Backblaze B2.
- `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`: Docker configuration files for containerized execution.

## Prerequisites

- Windows 10 version 2004 and higher or Windows 11
- Administrator privileges on your Windows machine
- Internet connection
- Backblaze B2 account information:
  - Application Key ID
  - Application Key
  - Bucket Name
  - File ID (optional)

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone this repository or download and unzip the package on your local machine.

2. Navigate into the `backblaze-recovery` directory and start the recovery-process either by running:
  - `./Recovery-Setup1.ps1` in your console, or by right-clicking the script and selecting the `Run with Powershell` option.

This will set up WSL2 and Docker Desktop. Your system will restart after this step.

4. After the system restarts, the second part of the setup should run automatically, but in case it doesn't:
  - `.\Recovery-Setup2.ps1`
  
This script will complete the Docker Desktop installation and prepare for data restoration.

5. During setup, you'll be prompted to enter your Backblaze B2 credentials and choose between full bucket sync or single file retrieval.

6. The restore process will start automatically using Docker. You can monitor the progress in the Docker Desktop dashboard or command line.

## Restoration Options

As we're running this operation through a virtual Linux distribution and using volume mounting for persistence, I believe this will allow us to get around your filename length issue.

### Full Bucket Sync:
This option downloads all files from your specified Backblaze B2 bucket to your local machine. 
- give the answer `full` during setup when prompted for this option.

### Single File Retrieval:
This option allows you to download a specific file from your Backblaze B2 bucket using its file ID. 
- give the answer `single` during setup when prompted for this option.
    - this will require you input the file ID and a destination folder name.

## Troubleshooting

- For PowerShell installation issues, ensure you're running the script with administrative privileges.
- If you encounter Docker-related problems, check the Docker Desktop dashboard for logs and error messages.
- For Backblaze B2 restoration issues, verify your credentials and bucket information.

## Security Note

This tool handles sensitive information like your Backblaze B2 credentials. Always run these scripts in a secure environment and never share your credentials.
